I've personally spent a few days to understand how to optimize the Customerly Live Chat plugin to rank on the top positions for certain keywords. This is the results: 2 position for a popular keyword like \"free live chat\" and top 10 for \"live chat\". When we launched this on WordPress we were on the 33rd position with the same keyword.  3 days later we were 5th. Now we are 2nd.  Our active installs are definitely lower than our competitors but still, we are there.  This brought to our platform 15K+ users to signup. Cost per acquisition? Zero. Time to execute: one week.

All that I had were the blogs I read, podcasts I listened to, and luckily some sales experience from having done door to door. Here’s what I tried in the first 3 months of trying to find clients: * I built a website on wordpress and made it look really pretty * I went to networking events and talked about my business * I wrote blog posts and content that I shared on social media * I made my own facebook group and tried to invite people to join * I messaged people on Linkedin randomly **Every week, I would try a new strategy. However, If it didn’t work, I would give up and move on to another next shiny new tactic. Thing was, most of my execution wasn’t done with amazing planning, so it often didn’t work. I ended up being on this crazy hamster wheel, wasting of time, and getting discouraged.** I did manage to land a couple clients here and there over the next few months, but every client came from a different tactic. I never found a consistent way to win clients on a rinse and repeat way. Client acquisition felt a bit out of my control and reliant on luck. After having this drag on for a little while longer, I eventually gave up. It was giving me more anxiety than it was worth. **If I had to summarize, my two biggest mistakes were this:** * In the beginning, I didn’t prioritize sales enough. I spent too much time doing everything BUT talking to clients * Once I started trying to sell, I was improvising and changing my approach every other week. Because I had no consistency, no process, and no methodical way of going after clients, I eventually burnt out Since then, I spent the last 6 years working at startups so I could learn from founders who’d actually built and exited from cool companies. I managed to learn a ton from them, and it’s really helped me now that I’m back to running my own business again. If I was to give advice to give my younger self, it would say these things to him: 1. Before investing time and energy into stuff like making a website, ideating sophisticated funnels, or even investing too much into product development, you need to have conversations with your ideal audience. That other stuff comes AFTER you get some early positive feedback from the audience. Talk to them first, and validate that the problem you’re solving actually exists and is significant enough for them to spend money on fixing. Without this confirmation, you don’t have a business. So don’t put the cart before the horse. 1. When it comes to generating leads and clients, don’t improvise. If you try a whole bunch of sh*t that you heard on some random podcast with no overarching strategy, you can’t be surprised when it doesn’t pan out. You want to be super methodical about what growth tactics you use. Choose a growth tactic that aligns with where your clients spend their time, is realistic within your capital constraints, is consistent with the type of offering you are selling, and is something you can actually execute with the skillset that you have. 1. Test your growth tactics in small batches. If you have 4 different ideas on how to drive clients, treat it like you’re a scientist running different tests. Try tactic #1 over the course of 2-3 weeks, and calculate how much money/time/energy it took you. Then see the results as far as sales opportunities generated, deals won, and profit made. Then, rinse and repeat with tactic #2. Then tactic #3. So on so forth. After a few months, you can look back at all the “test tubes” you tried out, and you can double down on what worked best. That way, you aren’t putting all your eggs into a basket and risking all your time and energy on one thing. You roll things out in a small scale, and whatever works best, you truly commit to doing it in a larger scale. Let the evidence and data guide your decision making. Gut feel is not how great entrepreneurs win. 1. Once you figure out your growth strategy, you gotta be CONSISTENT, DISCIPLINED, and ORGANIZED in your execution. For example, if you’re doing cold outreach, you need to be emailing or calling at least a minimum amount of people every single day, no ifs ands or buts. You have to be tracking your activity level with a spreadsheet or CRM and holding yourself accountable. You need to be measuring your conversion rates at each stage of your sales funnel. Or if you’re doing content, you have to make sure you’re posting at least a certain number of times per week, and following an organized schedule. You have to be measuring how many people consume your content, and the conversion rates on how many of those people turn into a sales meeting, and so on. 1. Lastly, be patient. Once you decide that a certain route is the right route, you have to fully commit to doing it properly over a long enough time. Even if you’re doing everything right, results won’t magically appear after a week. You have to grind at it a bit and let things slowly materialize. Quitting on a strategy because it didn’t land you a client in the first 7 days is insane. Give it a chance to deliver the results. Those lessons have served me well in my newest venture, and is definitely a big part of why I've been able to scale so quickly this time around. So this was my rant. Hopefully you found this helpful. If anyone has any thoughts, or even just wants to stay connected on Facebook, send me a friend request. As well, I’m trying to make a habit of writing more, so if there are any other topics people wanna hear about, just drop it in the comment below! I’m always open to growing my network and meeting other founders and entrepreneurs.

Then they can click the \"Sign up\" button, which leads to the other website with a web app (another server on a subdomain). They can register there, and their user account is created in the app's database.  We can analyze traffic and sources of our websites using Google Analytics. However, if we take a specific user account, we cannot tell where he came from if it was Facebook, Quora, Youtube. And if this was an affiliate link, we would also love being able to record the ref link parameters to identify the affiliate partner).

But I am sure there are better ways of doing that, possibly utilizing some SaaS app. What would you suggest?

It would be great if we could add some JS snippet to the homepage, and another snippet that adds custom user data like ID, email, etc. (a similar way that we implement Intercom on our pages).

Because it allows you to qualify your audience. You don't need to be creating content that talks about how great your product is. All you need to do is create content that only your audience would find valuable, *and no one else*. This is **especially critical for B2B** since finding B2B leads are both difficult and expensive to get. Just by having your ideal audience raise their hand by reading content that speaks directly to them, you then have the opportunity to follow up with them for your offer. And that's where lead generation / email marketing comes in... B2B sales cycles are long. Purchase decisions are not made impulsively. The person that wins is the one that is top-of-mind when a business is ready to buy.  Only after nurturing them **with value**, do you have the right to put an irresistible offer that may incentive them to take the leap with your solution. Once you figure out alllllll that, then you're ready for paid ads.

As a first-time SaaS founder, I've learned so much from all the amazing people in this community and it was important for me to give back and share my learnings... So here's the recap of the last 3 years as a first-time SaaS founder: * Went from 0 to $4,000,000 ARR with lemlist * Sold lempod, our side project, after 18 months of hypergrowth * Scale our team to 23 amazing people * Raised $0 in fundings (fully bootstrapped) Here are the 7 key elements that have helped us get where we’re at today: 1- Build a family around your product instead of a community. Communities die, families prosper. 2- Invest heavily in your product - if you don't have a kickass product you will not make money. Product led growth is 🔥 3- Having a long term vision is far less important than being adaptable. Talk to your users every single day and adapt. Your goal is to find a solution to a problem. People who usually \"know better\" usually fail. 4- Without a kick-ass team you won't scale as fast. Invest in hiring and in making your recruitment process smooth. 5- Build processes from day 1. Everyone should be replaceable, processes will help you do just that! 6- Be transparent. Really. The more transparent the better your relationships will be. Whether it's with your customers, your team or the outside world. 7- Surround yourself with love ❤️  Building a business is not easy. It's a roller coaster and your motivation level need to be as high as possible if you want to succeed! If you want more details I will put the link to the whole article in the first comment.

Digging into the terms, I found that Ahrefs is going to use your site data: Ahrefs may anonymize and aggregate any data you share with the Service, including data associated with your Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts, and use it without identifying you for purposes of improving the Service - source: Ahrefs terms Why is this bad? Your keyword ranking and backlink data cannot be anonymized. They are not unique to you. When Ahrefs learns that your page is getting 1000 visits/month from a keyword it shows as volume 50, it's going to update those estimates. Suddenly, you lose your competitive edge and paying Ahrefs customers can get better insights than ever before. On the plus side, it's going to make Ahrefs data 10x better for paying customers, as the competitor data will only improve. To sum up, I don't recommend anyone uses AWT on their own sites, unless you're happy for competitors to see their site data too.16 1619 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3246852942036536/"},{"post":" Building a free personal website with Notion.

I’ll show you how to calculate it below using an example from my past experience.  We were acquiring paying users for about $100 on a $50/mo subscription.  At the time, we were spending $3k/mo or $100/day so every day we were getting 1 paying user.  By the start of the next week, we only had 7 data points, which is not enough data to optimize the campaign.  So we waited.  And waited.  And only by the end of the month, after 30 more users, were we able to analyze the paying users and make tweaks to dial in the strategy. Now, let’s say this company started with $1000/mo - an arbitrary number I see a lot of business owners allocate to this.  That has effectively 3x’d the time needed to make the same analyzations at only 30 paying users. And now that client has paid 3x the amount in management fees to whoever was managing the campaign. What was being “saved” in adspend was then paid in management.  Sure, you can run ads yourself for as little as $5/day. And I recommend that just to test the waters and START - but not if you’re paying someone to do your ads, regardless if it’s a contractor, employee, or vendor.

My answer is Partnerships, and I’m going to explain the why and how in this post. Of all the methods available, Partnerships are the best way to create quick grow that’s measurable and affordable. Better than ads and content marketing. Why? Let’s take content marketing first. Karl Kangur rightly said that it’s like the compound effect in investing. Yes, in the long run, content marketing wins hands down. But when you’re a team of less than 10 people and you have salaries to pay and 3 months of runway left, content marketing isn’t going to get you there. You need faster results. What about ads, then? You get instant results don’t you? Well, for ads to work you need to be able to commit at least $3k/mo for 2-3 months up front. That’s because there’s a lot of experimentation involved before you figure out the right targeting and messaging. You’ll probably break even or lose money at this stage. So when I answer this question, I’m thinking about the practicality of it, and the realities I’ve faced growing companies from less than 10 people and barely any revenue to millions of dollars.  When I was VP of Growth at Thinkific (I recently left to start my own SaaS marketing consultancy) Partnerships killed it for us. In the early days, one webinar with a big influencer can drive enough revenue for you to stay alive and try other methods. Partnerships can be broken down into 3 general categories - Influencers, Affiliates, and Software/Integration partners. In this post, I’ll start with my process for attracting Influencers. I’ll do follow up posts on the other two categories next week. Influencers are individuals who have large followings. What these influencers say, their followers do. So if they say you’re SaaS is the best, you’ve hit gold. To get them to do that, you need to build relationships. You can’t simply reach out to influencers and say, “Hey! Promote my app.” You need to give value first. Whenever I meet an influencer online or offline, the first thing I ask is, “What can I help you with?” I've converted die-hard influencers of competitors with that one question. If they have a new product or launch coming up, I help them promote it, with no expectations in return. There was one influencer whose book I promoted for 1.5 years before he started working with us. Now he’s a raving fan. The bigger the influencer, the better for you but the harder they are to reach. So start with smaller ones. Find people who have followers of less than 100K. For these, it often just takes a friendly phone call before they’re willing to do a promotion. Again, reach out asking how you can help them. As you build these, some of the bigger influencers will start to notice you. Some may even reach out to you. If they don’t, you can reach out to them because you have something more to offer. Many of the really big influencers have gatekeepers so, instead of going around them, build the relationship with these gatekeepers first. Where do you find influencers? Well, you probably have already heard of the big ones. The rest can be found on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Anywhere that people are creating content and have a following. Survey your audience to find out who they follow. Once you’ve made the connection, the best way to drive growth from the partnership is via a webinar. The influencer will email their audience inviting them to your webinar where you can do your thing. Over the last two years I’ve done over 200 webinars. Hopefully this sheds some light on how to get influencers and rapidly grow your SaaS. Over the years, I’ve developed processes and checklists to make this run like a well-oiled machine. Comment below if you want that and I’ll compile them into a document after taking out sensitive company info. My next post will be on Software Partners.
