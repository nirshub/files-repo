From there, a some of these visitors will get on a sales call. And some will subscribe and become paying customers. But even with this process, a lot of people still run into problems. **Do these things to make the job easier: ** * Start the blog post with a story with emotions that people feel when dealing with your customer's problem. * Tie the story to a news article. Do a quick Google news search and you'll find somewhere, a news story broke related to your customer's problem. * Tie it all up after that with how your solution has helped the first guy in the story, and potentially many others (from the news story) * Stay consistent and publish two answers (articles) a week. Watch the traffic come trickling, then pouring in after two to three months * And be patient (but not too patient) That's it.

FAQs are indeed great assets to have; they reduce the workload on support teams and help in SEO as well.  We were pondering questions like: Is building FAQ pages the best solution to present FAQs to customers? Can it be done through live chat? Can it be done in a way that customer doesn't have hop between self-help and customer support? We have summed up our thoughts in this post: https://blog.kommunicate.io/why-should-you-delete-your-faq-page-e60933050643 Tl;dr - People search, they don’t browse. FAQs should be a part of chat only so the customers can search for the answers there itself. And we have been building Liz, an FAQ bot that will facilitate intelligent FAQs in the live chat itself. Would love to hear your thoughts on the positives and negatives of this.3 318 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/1623680484353798/"},{"post":"  Photos from Radu Plugaru's post+544 4476 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/2841696565885511/"},{"post":" …blog post. :) +++ Writing an article for Sumo :) What are the best marketing blogs in 2020?docs.google.comBest Marketing Blogs Survey35 3544 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/2721750841213418/"},{"post":" …someone who could benefit from an in-depth blog post in exchange for a simple testimonial of my work (if you like it).

We added the prospects domain as a tracking tag on each link to dynamically personalise the article to the prospect. STEP FOUR: Let the Phantom Magic Begin PhantomBuster does have a paid plan, starting at $30 per month, which gets you one hour of processing per day, so we plumbed for that one. However there is a free plan, if you want to dip your toe in first, which gives you ten minutes execution time free per day. With the Google Sheet of websites using Intercom to hit, I shared the Sheet direct with the PhantomBuster Intercom API, and pasted in the message, with the dynamic tags, and let it go… THE RESULTS: After the one hour of processing we’d sent out 168 messages and got an initial 14 direct email responses, either asking questions, or providing another contact. In addition to the direct responses, our traffic spiked to the article we’d shared in the message. In the end we managed to send out 168 messages, generating 99 page visits and 14 email responses. This generated 3 Calendly demo bookings and 9 trial signups and an affiliate sign-up (so far…) For a pro-rata daily spend of $1 we generated 13 solid opportunities and much more potential. Even better, now we’ve proven this, we can scale this out, with plenty of data and options to go at.

It was published on the Sumo blog on Monday. My hypothesis is that my article backed by data will get more shares, backlinks and traffic than a massive listicle on \"101 Blog Post Ideas.\" It will also get more dwell time and scroll depth (all major ranking factors Google likes) because the \"data\" article is more actionable and interesting.

Here's 9 things you can do to improve your SaaS landing page conversions 🔽 **One goal** 50% of founders had one clear goal for their landing page - sign up, download a lead magnet, or book a demo. The other 50% had multiple, often equally prioritised call-to-actions. This often leads to analysis paralysis and confusion for the visitor. Fix: Focus your landing page on one conversion goal. **A focus on USPs** After booking a roast, customers of Roast My Landing Page are asked to fill in a quick questionnaire. One of the questions is \"what makes your business unique?\" Nearly every founder was able to capture their product or business USPs gracefully in the form, but only about 1 in 5 had this language on their landing page. One of the key take aways from your landing page needs to be what makes you unique. If a buyer is in the consideration stage (comparing solutions) your USP is what is going to make them recall you, and decide if you are the best fit for their needs. Fix: Contrast your product with competitors and the current way of doing things. **Clear, relevant social proof** Testimonials, ratings, awards or quantifications to evidence that other people use and love your product. Only about 40% of landing pages had it above the fold (what people see when they first land on your page). And of those, only about 50% used testimonial language that was consistent with the pain and benefits listed elsewhere on the landing page. Fix it: Move your social proof up the page, make sure it's concise, compounds your copy, and from a buyer relevant to the visitor. **Simple language** About 1 in 8 landing pages I read, I couldn't comprehend on first read-through. These landing pages required several attempts to simply 'get it'. I had a monetary incentive to try and work out what was going on - your visitors do not. Fix it: Avoid technical terms and acronyms, and write in plain language. Remember you're talking to a human, even if they are a B2B buyer. Ask yourself if a 12 year old could understand your landing page. **Real pain** PAS (pain - agitate - solve) is a common copywriting technique used to increase conversion. Most landing pages touched on the pain they were addressing, but only 1 in 15 agitated or amplified the pain with emotional language and vivid imagery. The ones that did this well created much more powerful landing pages that moved me to explore the solution. Fix it: Agitate your visitor by painting a vivid picture of the pain using emotional language, stories and visuals. **Clear benefits and use cases** Lots of pages talked in-detail about product functions but ignored benefits and use cases. Research consistently shows higher conversion with benefits-based language. It was left to the visitor to think how the product would benefit them, or specifically solve their problem. Fix it: Visitors shouldn't have to work out how and why the product will benefit them. Tell and show them with clear benefits language, and example use cases. **Signposted CTAs** So many landing pages had a call-to-action to do something, without clear signposting around the action. Yes, they were they about to sign up but... how long would it take? What were they agreeing to? How much would it cost? What technical setup was involved? Fix it: add context to your CTA so the visitor knows what to expect. **Asking instead of over-thinking** 3 in 5 founders mentioned a level of frustration over not knowing what was happening during the pre-roast survey. They weren't sure why their landing page wasn't converting visitors into customers. However, very few had actually asked their visitors.79 7919 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3872706716117819/"},{"post":" …in here?
