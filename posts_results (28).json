I mean - our product onboarding platform is great, but it seems next to impossible to be found via seo as our competition has bigger resources to push their content than we have.  All agencies are telling me - you have to be patient, pay us for at least 6 month and you will see the results. Well - they say that to everybody and we all can't fit on the 1st google page right? We have decided to produce quality content on our blog. But who will find it and how? Would love to hear your experience. Thank you.18 18102 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/4137560062965815/"},{"post":" Any recommendations for a blog platform?

I was looking for a tool to use as an internal blog or intranet and was wondering if anyone might have a recommendation.  I noticed that Zapier uses an internal tool called Async but it is not available publicly. p2theme.com is good for quick updates but it is not that great to have more organized posts (company updates, etc).1 14 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/1932390016816175/","year":"2018"},{"post":" …we are there.

It's much more like Medium, Ghost or WordPress but the full-fledged solution and very easy for non-coders. Their Pro plan usually cost $30 per month but on AppSumo, they are giving it away for just $49 for the lifetime and that with no cap on monthly Traffic. ( Don't know why and how) There are various design and technical limitations currently since it's just 6 months old startup but with such a great team and advisors who back them, so I believe they will rise soon. If you want to know about the current drawback or limitations of this platform, read my comments ( with username Nano Whiz) on the Appsumo. Let me know what you think of it and try to convince me to save next $100 that I want to invest in stocking two more of this. :)appsumo.comLifetime Access to Verst | Exclusive Offer from AppSumo11 1130 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/1360903733964809/","year":"2017"},{"post":" …texts on the blog for our Digital Adoption platform www.productfruits.com.
