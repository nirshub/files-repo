They accepted the sunk cost and pivoted to focus on the software they had built their internal sales reps. **üëâ Step 2 ‚Äì Close Your First 100 Customers (And Angel Investors) Door To Door ** Now most early stage SaaS founders do stuff like this to get customers: * Launch on Product Hunt * List on startup directories * Apply to TechCrunch Disrupt Pitch Competition * Export the email addresses of all their Linkedin connections and spam the lot of them * Create Twitter, Linkedin and Facebook Pages and invite their friends to like and follow Manny hit the streets of SoMa in San Francisco to close Outreach's first 100 customers and first few angel investors at the same time. (Apparently AWS threw him out of their office at the time - they are now a customer). **üëâ Step 3 ‚Äì Ignore [Marketing](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6607262380458160128&keywords=%23Marketing&originTrackingId=8KugDCOXSDWhsepR0VPHaw%3D%3D) For 2-3 Years ** Outreach don't have a .com domain, their Twitter profile is average at best and their site used to look horrendous. Why?  Because marketing didn't used to be their channel. They just got really good at outbound sales, and I mean REALLY good (see Step 8) **üëâ Step 4 ‚Äì Develop An Extremely Agile Product Release Schedule ** Outreach release new code 3 times per week.  That is all. **üëâ Step 5 ‚Äì Choose A B2C North Star Metric?!? ** Outreach don't look at churn, they look at monthly active users - kind of like a social network would. As they know that if they get users in new accounts using the product... chances of churn reduce massively. They current net revenue churn is 140%. üò≤ **üëâ Step 6 ‚Äì Create A Category & Write The Book ** Here‚Äôs the formula: 1. Build a mildly differentiated product 1. Make up a name for the new category this product will sit in 1. Write a book with the category name as the title 1. Become a unicorn Drift did it with Conversational Marketing and now are worth more than $500m. Outreach did it with Sales Engagement and are now worth $1.1bn. **üëâ Step 7 ‚Äì Become Obsessed With Your Trade ** Outreach's SDR to AE ratio (e.g. the number of \"prospectors\" needed to provide meetings for the \"closers\") is 1:2. That means that 1 \"prospector\" can book enough meetings for 2 \"closers\". Unheard of... Nathan asked Manny how they do this in an interview... Manny just says: \"We use Outreach\". **üëâ Step 8 ‚Äì Develop A Metric Driven [Outbound Process**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6607262380458160128&keywords=%23OutboundProcess&originTrackingId=8KugDCOXSDWhsepR0VPHaw%3D%3D) Outreach customise their outbound process based on persona and industry. For example, a sales operations manager in the SaaS space may receive every different outbound tactic from direct mail to event invite over a 6 month period whereas is the sales enablement manager in the retail space would only receive outbound emails and Linkedin messages. **üëâ Step 9 ‚Äì Steal Competitor Traffic ** 61% of 30k per month paid traffic sessions come from bidding on competitor branded search terms. **üëâ Step 10 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Grow An Audience: Buy One ** Max Altschuler, founder of Sales Hacker heads to the Outreach conference in May 2018 and asks Outreach CEO, Manny a single question: *‚ÄúWhat keeps you up at night?‚Äù* He replies: *‚ÄúMarketing‚Äù* This is the answer that Max was looking for: *‚ÄúSure, then why not marry up the best in class sales technology with the leading B2B sales media company?‚Äù* Outreach then bought Sales Hacker and still run it as a separate entity to this day. **üëâ Step 11 ‚Äì Buy People‚Äôs [SaaS](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6607262380458160128&keywords=%23SaaS&originTrackingId=8KugDCOXSDWhsepR0VPHaw%3D%3D) Then Get Them To Link To You ** Outreach got a 92 DR backlink from a Zendesk case study. E.g. Outreach bought Zendesk, then Zendesk link to Outreach - pretty simple right? :) **üëâ Step 12 ‚Äì Bust Churn By Facilitating Friendships ** Enter \"Outreach Peak\" the community JUST for Outreach customers... How much less likely would you be churn if you have 5 good friends in the community? **üëâ Step 13 ‚Äì Throw A Massive Party (And Get Other People To Pay For It) ** Outreach host an annual conference called Unleash, they have 26 sponsors likely paying between $5-30k and charge attendees $995 to attend. **üëâ Step 14 ‚Äì Turn Employees Into Authors ** Outreach have built a section on their blog where employees are free to write about anything Sales Engagement - immediately getting more eyeballs on Outreach content from people within employee networks (good for referral sales and employees). **üëâ Step 15 ‚Äì Get Wall Street To Pay Employee Bonuses ** Outreach is considering going public to align shareholder, management and employee incentives, just like Manny's old boss at Amazon. **üëâ Step 16 ‚Äì Capture The Data Then Become The Platform** Outreach is following in the footsteps of  * Salesforce AppExchange * Shopify App Store * Apple App Store by releasing the Outreach Galaxy. They have the customer data so external developers will build on top, bringing product insights and additional revenue. *I hope this helps anyone here that is looking to grow hard and fast, Nathan and I will be in the comments if you have any questions!*158 15863 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/2530651836989987/","year":"2018"},{"post":" ‚Ä¶while plugging your blog posts. > Create visuals to support your blog posts and share with media or influencers to re-use on their site (with a link) or share on social.

But a blog is a great way to give cold outreach a break and let the leads come knocking.  The problem is content writing takes a lot of time.  There's research, writing, editing, and publishing. Then try doing all of that twice a week. In the meantime you are refining your product and handling your clients. It's also a pain to think of new blog ideas every week. Instead of trying to write \"awesome content\" as a lot of marketing gurus call it, just focus on answering questions. When I sit down in front of a blank Google doc, it takes forever to get those first sentences down. Writer's block hits me like a brick and I soon enough I start scrolling around internet.  So how did I produce 60 articles for my travel platform in 3 months? I answered questions that people have.  I start with a question I've heard someone ask. I imagine I was at a bar chatting over a beer, using a conversational tone to write.(because it reads easier.)  Before I knew it, I filled up two pages of content in 20 minutes. These articles are now bringing a steady flow of traffic to my platform.  **How does this work for a SaaS business?** Your customers have questions. The answers create even more questions.  For every question you've heard a customer ask - in a forum - at a cocktail party - or in a sales call Take 30 minutes a day to write down the answer and publish it on your SaaS blog. Write two blog posts a week just by anticipating your customers questions and then answering them one by one. It just so happens that most Google searches start with a question too.  Now the magic happens, and your customers start landing on your website thanks to your blog post with a question headline. **Here is a process I use.** Pick a problem your product solves. Write a question related to the problem, like: \"How to write two articles a week for my SaaS blog?\" Do this twice a week, and you‚Äôll see traffic come back to your blog post from Google searches. From there, a some of these visitors will get on a sales call. And some will subscribe and become paying customers. But even with this process, a lot of people still run into problems. **Do these things to make the job easier: ** * Start the blog post with a story with emotions that people feel when dealing with your customer's problem. * Tie the story to a news article. Do a quick Google news search and you'll find somewhere, a news story broke related to your customer's problem. * Tie it all up after that with how your solution has helped the first guy in the story, and potentially many others (from the news story) * Stay consistent and publish two answers (articles) a week. Watch the traffic come trickling, then pouring in after two to three months * And be patient (but not too patient) That's it. Let me know if you have any questions on the process I've been using for my own business and my client's.

As unarguably one of the best and one of the only few websites in this domain, Glorify deserved a better online presence; and for that, they needed a better website design, a better marketing strategy, and a better overall game plan. After establishing a solid understanding of the problem within our team, we devised a new and effective SEO strategy to get the ball rolling. **SEO Audit** Through our deep-dive, we realized that there were multiple technical and security issues on the website, and fixing those took the top spot on our priority list. Crawler issues, Missing canonical tags, JavaScript vulnerabilities and security headers, etc. were some major issues to name.  **UX Design** The next step was the website overhaul. Our team brainstormed to find ways to make the website look more interactive and have an efficient website funnel; both from an SEO  as well as a customer standpoint. **On-Page Optimization** There was a serious gap between how Glorify's services were portrayed on the platform versus how the potential customers were searching for the same services. This mismatch resulted in the potential customers not converting to actual customers. In order to fix this issue, we curated an inventory of top keywords via an exhaustive competitor analysis and search volumes and created respective product pages for the same. Once we had the list in hand, we optimized their metas and resolved the gap from a technical SEO perspective. **On-Site Content** Until our collaboration, Glorify did not have any live blogs. Hence, the strategy here was to aggressively post fully optimized blogs on the website; with at least 1-2 articles going live per day for the initial 2 months; and 3-4 articles per week eventually. All the identified topics were strategically chosen based on multiple data points like the current trends, search volumes, competitor analysis, long-tail keywords, etc. The content was also refreshed on a regular basis to ensure the content freshness and to send across the right signals to AI bots. As a result, the impact was so high that we ranked our 1st keyword \"Funny zoom backgrounds\" in the top 3 positions globally, with 135k monthly search volume (Data source: SEMrush). Additionally, the overall search keywords (the top 100) went from 168 to 25,200 within 10 months. Link Building  Initially, for the first two months, we focused on web 2.0, forum, and profile links. Post which, our outreach team approached site owners within the same niche with high-quality, relevant links for link-building purposes, amongst multiple other technical factors. **Results: A Clear Win!** * **146.87%** growth in organic conversions * **1512%** increase in organic traffic in just 10 months * **112 **keywords started ranking on the top 3 positions depicting a 1600% growth * **976** keywords started ranking on the 4-10 positions * **415.70%** growth in backlinks * **12x growth** in revenues purely via organic channels P.S.

One of the reasons I figured out is that there are just too many articles on a topic that one tends to get overwhelmed. So, here I want to ask you to recommend your best article/blog which you have come across for the following topics - On User Awareness -  1. Best practices to improve website traffic using organic means  2. Best practices to increase impression for your paid marketing campaigns  3. Best practices to increase email open rates for cold outreach On User acquisition/conversion -  1. Best practices to convert a visitor to user through website  2. Best practices to landing pages for more conversions  3. Best practices to get user perform a goal in a web app/mobile app User engagement -  1. Best practice to get users spend more time on the app  2. Best practice to improve bounce rates User retention -  1. Best practice to increase frequency and recency of logins  2. Best practice to increase repeat website visitors (pre-login behavior)  3. Best practice to get a user upgrade to higher price plans I know this would require some effort. What basically I want to do is to identify the most common pattern and list it point wise. May be we can together work on a wiki thing and keep on updating the same? What say?  The idea from this also emerged when I was thinking of some content for my platform. And I said, why to reinvent the wheel. Rather, I would like to embed such kind of wiki on my site and let others also get the same benefit. Do you think above makes sense to you? As we keep on identifying a new point which is way unique, then we can just add the references and the summarized point. P.S:  1.

We wanted to change recruitment and become a unicorn. It was a marketplace where we didn‚Äôt manage to acquire two types of target audiences ‚Äì companies and job seekers. It was a very challenging time. However, I decided to move forward and focus only on the B2B market. After a long time, I decided to create a new product for team management space and now everything will be different. First, it‚Äôs an open startup. Second, I will publish our journey and share all pitfalls and challenges we overcome. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs time for Hard Core Year. Our goal is **$100k ARR in 1 year**. 2020 is a really unusual year and as they said crisis is the best time for the new opportunities. Let‚Äôs check it out. **What‚Äôs Hard Core Year?** Kick ass challenge to get out of the comfort zone. Hard Core Year is the public and ambitious goal with sharing all key details during the journey. You will see the main problems we solve (or not) and of course data (probably, the most interesting for you :)). I am going to publish results at the end of each month. I was inspired by great entrepreneurs who have already had their Hard Core Years. Here are the few of them: * Andrei Asimov (Completed) * Reilly Chaze (Completed) * Jon Yongfook * Alex Turnbull from Groove (Completed) **Why $100k ARR?** $100k ARR is a great milestone to validate an idea of the startup. It means ~8.3k MRR, which allows us to live and to develop the business. I want to build a profitable business that earns money without venture investments and has enough growth to make a successful company. There is a decent amount of interesting entrepreneurs who tell their story. Groove, Andrei Azimov, Reilly Chaze, and others. They have already had great results and some of them completed their Hard Core Year. This blog might be interested for you as I start from scratch now. I will share pitfalls, mistakes, and insights I get as a founder of the early-stage startup. I will show how we make a startup in 2020. Each month I publish an update with key metrics. I hope it will help others to start their journey and make something valuable for the world. **What is Focus?** My passion is simplifying complex things. We have a lot of different stuff every day. Different tools for work, challenges, goals, channels, news, and so on. That‚Äôs why I want to build a tool that helps companies to manage their team in a much better way than they have it now. To cut everything that is not important and focus on what really matters. Focus is a team management software that helps to connect strategy with daily operations. It allows to get employees feedback and set the objectives. It‚Äôs not a usual project management tool. Because task managers don‚Äôt solve the real problem of management. They allow to do good task lists. However, many companies struggle with leadership and management. Employees don‚Äôt know how they affect the company‚Äôs goals. They even don‚Äôt know what are the main company‚Äôs goals in most cases. These issues and unskillful management directly impacts employees‚Äô happiness and engagement. According the Gallup survey, 66% of employees are disengaged in their job. I want to fix it and make it better by giving companies the best tool to manage their teams. **What‚Äôs next?** I will publish updates at the end of a month.

And it‚Äôs pretty damn good too.... If you think about a specific topic related to anything B2B, from sales to productivity, there will be some household SaaS company dominating that space on Google search So if you have a small team, or even if you‚Äôre a solopreneur getting your SaaS off the ground, here are 4 quick tips for writing quality content your users will love (and you can apply these tactics on TOF / MOF / BOF content) 1. Talk about inferior solutions to your market‚Äôs problem - show them the problem of doing things the old way, it will get the problem resolved, but not as good as your product 1. Close the ‚Äòknowledge gap‚Äô - in many cases, your users won‚Äôt be able to fully succeed at whatever they are set out to do, even with your product. There is always a GAP between your users with your product in their hands, and their desired outcome. Close this gap with knowledge. Example: > Your user wants to create a landing page for their business > You offer a landing page builder Great right? Everything should work out! In reality there is a lot more that goes into a high-converting landing page. Copywriting, design, the right tracking, etc. Unless they grasp these elements, they will not truly achieve their desired goal. Educate them on how to really achieve their goal 3) Find what your competition is writing about and drastically improve on it - whether you decide to go wide, deep or wide and deep, try to create far superior content 4) Redistribute your content - one blog can go a long way: video, PPT, Linkedin post, Linkedin article, infographic, reach out to people in your market to link back to it Now, if you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄòI‚Äôve heard this before‚Äô --- ask yourself, have you really tried it?  And I don‚Äôt mean for 2 days. The truth is there is no magic bullet or formula, there are some hacks and shortcuts (like this one)... but actually to get success with content marketing you have to create great content consistently (and that's the definition of content marketing...consistency) It does take work, but hopefully this will help! :))8 82 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/2287079924680514/","year":"2019"},{"post":"","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/2478150328906805/","year":"2019"},{"post":" ‚Ä¶a platform that allows us to scale up via templates (whether our existing blog environment on WordPress, or, investing in a new template via Instapage or LeadPages).

Blog posts, webinars, white papers, podcasts, events, ads, there are so many things to do and there isn‚Äôt one well-defined way to go about. And of course, you need to get the marketing backbone in place. Tracking everything end to end, lead scoring and nurturing, smooth handover of leads to sales teams, being up to date on latest tools and channels, building a team, structuring a team, keeping them motivated etc etc. This is not easy at all, especially at the growth stage where you need a predictable and repeatable engine. I feel it‚Äôs one of the biggest reasons why a lot of promising SaaS businesses, especially outside the Valley, are not able to reach their full potential, or take a lot longer to get there than they should trying to figure out this complex beast and making a lot of mistakes along the way. Solution: I am building a platform called MonkHD (https://www.monkhd.com/) where you can get on calls with SaaS marketing experts to get tailored advice to your marketing questions over calls paid by the hour (no matter which part of the world you are in). The experts come from popular SaaS companies like HubSpot and Zendesk, or are experts in specific areas like positioning, pricing, marketing automation, analytics etc. The model is similar to Clarity.fm which I have found very valuable but very specifically targeted to SaaS marketing for growing companies.

In addition to that, I wrote a few blog posts and created a few YouTube videos, but it was a very modest community. I think we had 300 YouTube subscribers after 12 months and only a hundred daily visitors to our blog. After about a year of creating content, we launched an e-commerce store to sell men‚Äôs grooming products and it‚Äôs been a grind ever since. Gradually, I reduced my commitment to my graphic design business and put those efforts into Beardbrand as it got traction. üìå ////  Describe the process of creating Beardbrand. ////    We launched the Beardbrand e-commerce store a few days before I found out that my wife was pregnant with our first child. That gave me a tight deadline to grow Beardbrand to the point it could support our family or else I‚Äôd have to go back to the corporate world. In those very early days of Beardbrand, there was a bit of luck on our side. First, we were pretty much the only organization that took growing beards seriously (today everyone and their mom talks about beards & beard care). Because of that, it was easy for us to get noticed. In November of 2012, I was contacted by a reporter from the New York Times who was doing a piece on beards. I told my co-founders about it and suggested that we take advantage of the publicity and try to sell some products on an e-commerce store. It was at that moment that we decided to monetize the brand. We started our store by carrying a different brand‚Äôs products. I was familiar with a small beard oil & mustache wax manufacturer (think Etsy level business). So I reached out to that person and asked if we could resell their products at standard wholesale prices. He agreed, and we added two types of beard oil and one mustache wax available for purchase on our website. I believe the initial order was about $100 worth of products. For the platform, we decided to go with Shopify and built the website with one of their free templates. I used the photography from our manufacturer and wrote the copy myself. Because I was a graphic designer, I was able to build the website in about two days. We launched on January 28th, 2013, just two days before the New York Times article went live. I made a post on Facebook, and ironically the first customer of Beardbrand was also my first customer of my graphic design business. Then the New York Times article was published, which ended up driving about $515 worth of sales over the next seven days and gave me the motivation to grow and expand the business. In these early days, I was fulfilling the products myself and running them to the post office. Eventually, we partnered up with a fulfillment house so that we could focus on our marketing efforts. We are a truly bootstrapped company - no outside money, no bank loans, no debt. My co-founders purchased their shares of the company as we launched and we rolled any profits back into the business. We didn‚Äôt pull any cash out of the business for the first ten months, and then after that, it was a very modest salary. I‚Äôm fortunate to live a modest lifestyle, and my wife has a job that could support both of us. Without that, our story might be completely different. We were lucky to be the company to build a new industry - beard care. As the market leader, we were able to parlay that into copious amounts of PR which helped accelerate our growth. Our early wins were that NY Times article, but also we were included in some best beard oils articles that included our products. Those other articles ended up ranking well on Google and drove a good part of our business. Those articles were great, but our most significant PR event was appearing on Shark Tank on Halloween of 2014. The exposure from being on Prime Time TV is like none other. If you want to see what that did for our business, check out the write up I did over on Reddit. We‚Äôve continued to have a lean mentality with our product launches and offering. We create small initial batch runs and modify our products based on the feedback from our customers. This minimizes risk and allows us to continue to grow as a bootstrapped company. It was about 7 or 8 months in that I felt the business had potential to support me and my family. We were doing about $25k/month at that time, but still not pulling anything out of the business. I‚Äôve always thought Beardbrand has had potential to do 9 figures, so we are grinding away trying to figure out how to do that.

So here's the recap of the last 3 years as a first-time SaaS founder: * Went from 0 to $4,000,000 ARR with lemlist * Sold lempod, our side project, after 18 months of hypergrowth * Scale our team to 23 amazing people * Raised $0 in fundings (fully bootstrapped) Here are the 7 key elements that have helped us get where we‚Äôre at today: 1- Build a family around your product instead of a community. Communities die, families prosper. 2- Invest heavily in your product - if you don't have a kickass product you will not make money. Product led growth is üî• 3- Having a long term vision is far less important than being adaptable. Talk to your users every single day and adapt. Your goal is to find a solution to a problem. People who usually \"know better\" usually fail. 4- Without a kick-ass team you won't scale as fast. Invest in hiring and in making your recruitment process smooth. 5- Build processes from day 1. Everyone should be replaceable, processes will help you do just that! 6- Be transparent. Really. The more transparent the better your relationships will be. Whether it's with your customers, your team or the outside world. 7- Surround yourself with love ‚ù§Ô∏è  Building a business is not easy. It's a roller coaster and your motivation level need to be as high as possible if you want to succeed! If you want more details I will put the link to the whole article in the first comment. I hope that it will help you rock 2021 and that it might inspire some of you like I was inspired when I first started ‚ù§Ô∏è153 15357 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3529465173775310/","year":"2021"},{"post":" Knowledge base / help desk: I see so many SaaS using some expensive subscription solutions.

Hi there. Judging by the topics covered i dont see a lot of legal aspects covered in this group. Signing a customer is always fine and doable, but what do you do with all the GDPR issues, person data, and legal problems in general. As far as i know solutions like e-sign or docusign are not really viable instruments, as deemed not legal in actual court.

Ever wanted to pull a few million LI profiles and emails in an afternoon? Ever been tired of getting booted off LinkedIn for scraping too many profiles?  What most people don't realize is that Microsoft owns both Linkedin and Bing. This means that all LinkedIn profiles are perfectly indexed in Bing's search.  All you have to do to get them is use Bing's search operators to create your queries, then scrape the results and send them to your favorite email finding tool.  If you aren't a developer you can use Scrapebox.com to get the results.  If you are a developer, use scaleserp.com This process really gets interesting when you hit scale. You can only pull 1000 profiles per search but if you are creative in Google Sheets you can create hundreds of searches at a time. If I only need to search for one job title, I might grab a list of all cities in the US from Wikipedia and then add them to the end of each search. Now you have thousands of searches and millions of profiles.

I haven't had the privilege to work for a funded startup so I have always wondered this. Startup X grows consistently (kind of struggling though) but gets funding and grows exponentially. They obviously hired, spent money outsourcing growth tasks to someone, or invested in their growth stack. But what really happened after funding? If you have done this, can you share any insight or summary of things you did? I don't have funding or anything. This is coming from me as general wondering.25 2526 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/4188295107892310/"},{"post":" Why You Shouldn't Use Ahrefs Webmaster Tools, Ahrefs' New Free Audit, Keyword and Backlink Tool At first glance, it looks awesome: verify your site (by giving access to Google Search Console or via sitewide HTML tag) and get free unlimited access to their Site Audit and Site Explorer tools, where you can see: On-page SEO performance - find 404 pages, broken links, slow loading pages Organic keyword rankings - find which keywords your site ranks for Backlinks - find which websites link to you BUT there's a big catch. Digging into the terms, I found that Ahrefs is going to use your site data: Ahrefs may anonymize and aggregate any data you share with the Service, including data associated with your Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts, and use it without identifying you for purposes of improving the Service - source: Ahrefs terms Why is this bad? Your keyword ranking and backlink data cannot be anonymized. They are not unique to you. When Ahrefs learns that your page is getting 1000 visits/month from a keyword it shows as volume 50, it's going to update those estimates. Suddenly, you lose your competitive edge and paying Ahrefs customers can get better insights than ever before. On the plus side, it's going to make Ahrefs data 10x better for paying customers, as the competitor data will only improve. To sum up, I don't recommend anyone uses AWT on their own sites, unless you're happy for competitors to see their site data too.16 1619 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3246852942036536/","year":"2020"},{"post":" **SaaS screenshots** - how important do you think it is to include screenshots of your SaaS on your marketing website?

I think many saas platforms can learn from this. ü§î Your customer is in charge, not you. Build emotional buy-in. Platforms feel disconnected and your customer support feels cold.

Please, before you do though. Check out the website and think if you are really a fit (traffit.com). I'm looking to target HR managers, COO's and Recruitment agencies. I plan to have 50/50 inbound outbound strategy. The average price entry point is around $200 monthly (so consider if your product is not too expensive). We have negative churn so I can't tell you LTV yet, but that is also because we are young. We are bootstrapped and won't spend huge amounts on tech that I won't see an ROI on for 6+ months.
