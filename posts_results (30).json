Here's 9 things you can do to improve your SaaS landing page conversions üîΩ **One goal** 50% of founders had one clear goal for their landing page - sign up, download a lead magnet, or book a demo. The other 50% had multiple, often equally prioritised call-to-actions. This often leads to analysis paralysis and confusion for the visitor. Fix: Focus your landing page on one conversion goal. **A focus on USPs** After booking a roast, customers of Roast My Landing Page are asked to fill in a quick questionnaire. One of the questions is \"what makes your business unique?\" Nearly every founder was able to capture their product or business USPs gracefully in the form, but only about 1 in 5 had this language on their landing page. One of the key take aways from your landing page needs to be what makes you unique. If a buyer is in the consideration stage (comparing solutions) your USP is what is going to make them recall you, and decide if you are the best fit for their needs. Fix: Contrast your product with competitors and the current way of doing things. **Clear, relevant social proof** Testimonials, ratings, awards or quantifications to evidence that other people use and love your product. Only about 40% of landing pages had it above the fold (what people see when they first land on your page). And of those, only about 50% used testimonial language that was consistent with the pain and benefits listed elsewhere on the landing page. Fix it: Move your social proof up the page, make sure it's concise, compounds your copy, and from a buyer relevant to the visitor. **Simple language** About 1 in 8 landing pages I read, I couldn't comprehend on first read-through. These landing pages required several attempts to simply 'get it'. I had a monetary incentive to try and work out what was going on - your visitors do not. Fix it: Avoid technical terms and acronyms, and write in plain language. Remember you're talking to a human, even if they are a B2B buyer. Ask yourself if a 12 year old could understand your landing page. **Real pain** PAS (pain - agitate - solve) is a common copywriting technique used to increase conversion. Most landing pages touched on the pain they were addressing, but only 1 in 15 agitated or amplified the pain with emotional language and vivid imagery. The ones that did this well created much more powerful landing pages that moved me to explore the solution. Fix it: Agitate your visitor by painting a vivid picture of the pain using emotional language, stories and visuals. **Clear benefits and use cases** Lots of pages talked in-detail about product functions but ignored benefits and use cases. Research consistently shows higher conversion with benefits-based language. It was left to the visitor to think how the product would benefit them, or specifically solve their problem. Fix it: Visitors shouldn't have to work out how and why the product will benefit them. Tell and show them with clear benefits language, and example use cases. **Signposted CTAs** So many landing pages had a call-to-action to do something, without clear signposting around the action. Yes, they were they about to sign up but... how long would it take? What were they agreeing to? How much would it cost? What technical setup was involved? Fix it: add context to your CTA so the visitor knows what to expect. **Asking instead of over-thinking** 3 in 5 founders mentioned a level of frustration over not knowing what was happening during the pre-roast survey. They weren't sure why their landing page wasn't converting visitors into customers. However, very few had actually asked their visitors.79 7919 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3872706716117819/"},{"post":" What do You think? ü§îü§î42 4243 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3990017384386751/"},{"post":" Am I missing something or has LinkedIn turned into an automated lead-gen, spamming machine?

Ever wanted to pull a few million LI profiles and emails in an afternoon? Ever been tired of getting booted off LinkedIn for scraping too many profiles?  What most people don't realize is that Microsoft owns both Linkedin and Bing. This means that all LinkedIn profiles are perfectly indexed in Bing's search.  All you have to do to get them is use Bing's search operators to create your queries, then scrape the results and send them to your favorite email finding tool.  If you aren't a developer you can use Scrapebox.com to get the results.  If you are a developer, use scaleserp.com This process really gets interesting when you hit scale. You can only pull 1000 profiles per search but if you are creative in Google Sheets you can create hundreds of searches at a time. If I only need to search for one job title, I might grab a list of all cities in the US from Wikipedia and then add them to the end of each search. Now you have thousands of searches and millions of profiles.

As a first-time SaaS founder, I've learned so much from all the amazing people in this community and it was important for me to give back and share my learnings... So here's the recap of the last 3 years as a first-time SaaS founder: * Went from 0 to $4,000,000 ARR with lemlist * Sold lempod, our side project, after 18 months of hypergrowth * Scale our team to 23 amazing people * Raised $0 in fundings (fully bootstrapped) Here are the 7 key elements that have helped us get where we‚Äôre at today: 1- Build a family around your product instead of a community. Communities die, families prosper. 2- Invest heavily in your product - if you don't have a kickass product you will not make money. Product led growth is üî• 3- Having a long term vision is far less important than being adaptable. Talk to your users every single day and adapt. Your goal is to find a solution to a problem. People who usually \"know better\" usually fail. 4- Without a kick-ass team you won't scale as fast. Invest in hiring and in making your recruitment process smooth. 5- Build processes from day 1. Everyone should be replaceable, processes will help you do just that! 6- Be transparent. Really. The more transparent the better your relationships will be. Whether it's with your customers, your team or the outside world. 7- Surround yourself with love ‚ù§Ô∏è  Building a business is not easy.

My answer is Partnerships, and I‚Äôm going to explain the why and how in this post. Of all the methods available, Partnerships are the best way to create quick grow that‚Äôs measurable and affordable. Better than ads and content marketing. Why? Let‚Äôs take content marketing first. Karl Kangur rightly said that it‚Äôs like the compound effect in investing. Yes, in the long run, content marketing wins hands down. But when you‚Äôre a team of less than 10 people and you have salaries to pay and 3 months of runway left, content marketing isn‚Äôt going to get you there. You need faster results. What about ads, then? You get instant results don‚Äôt you? Well, for ads to work you need to be able to commit at least $3k/mo for 2-3 months up front. That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs a lot of experimentation involved before you figure out the right targeting and messaging. You‚Äôll probably break even or lose money at this stage. So when I answer this question, I‚Äôm thinking about the practicality of it, and the realities I‚Äôve faced growing companies from less than 10 people and barely any revenue to millions of dollars.  When I was VP of Growth at Thinkific (I recently left to start my own SaaS marketing consultancy) Partnerships killed it for us. In the early days, one webinar with a big influencer can drive enough revenue for you to stay alive and try other methods. Partnerships can be broken down into 3 general categories - Influencers, Affiliates, and Software/Integration partners. In this post, I‚Äôll start with my process for attracting Influencers. I‚Äôll do follow up posts on the other two categories next week. Influencers are individuals who have large followings. What these influencers say, their followers do. So if they say you‚Äôre SaaS is the best, you‚Äôve hit gold. To get them to do that, you need to build relationships. You can‚Äôt simply reach out to influencers and say, ‚ÄúHey! Promote my app.‚Äù You need to give value first. Whenever I meet an influencer online or offline, the first thing I ask is, ‚ÄúWhat can I help you with?‚Äù I've converted die-hard influencers of competitors with that one question. If they have a new product or launch coming up, I help them promote it, with no expectations in return. There was one influencer whose book I promoted for 1.5 years before he started working with us. Now he‚Äôs a raving fan. The bigger the influencer, the better for you but the harder they are to reach. So start with smaller ones. Find people who have followers of less than 100K. For these, it often just takes a friendly phone call before they‚Äôre willing to do a promotion. Again, reach out asking how you can help them. As you build these, some of the bigger influencers will start to notice you. Some may even reach out to you. If they don‚Äôt, you can reach out to them because you have something more to offer. Many of the really big influencers have gatekeepers so, instead of going around them, build the relationship with these gatekeepers first. Where do you find influencers? Well, you probably have already heard of the big ones. The rest can be found on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Anywhere that people are creating content and have a following. Survey your audience to find out who they follow. Once you‚Äôve made the connection, the best way to drive growth from the partnership is via a webinar. The influencer will email their audience inviting them to your webinar where you can do your thing. Over the last two years I‚Äôve done over 200 webinars. Hopefully this sheds some light on how to get influencers and rapidly grow your SaaS. Over the years, I‚Äôve developed processes and checklists to make this run like a well-oiled machine. Comment below if you want that and I‚Äôll compile them into a document after taking out sensitive company info. My next post will be on Software Partners.

However, still most of the emails are ending up in spam folder I checked the spam percentage from spam testing tool called glock apps and it is showing that about 50 % of the emails are going into spam folder.   Can you suggest any way to rectify this issue ?5 544 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/2457326784322493/","year":"2019"},{"post":" Are there any SaaS sales execs in here?

Here's what I found: **1. Cut All Other Options** ConvertKit's revenue actually declined through 2014 as Nathan was still focussing on other revenue streams (books and courses). Hiten Shah then told him at a conference in September 2014 that he should either shut it down or go full time. And the rest is history... **2. Developing The Necessary Skills** Before launching ConvertKit Nathan had: * Tried to launch multiple online businesses * Spent 6 years as an employee/freelancer in front end web development * Written and sold two books Without these skills, it's unlikely Nathan would have been able to build ConvertKit. **3. Embrace Your Inner Sales Person** So what online marketing strategy did Nathan select to find ConvertKit‚Äôs first customers? * Building an email list? * Content marketing? * Podcasting? * Facebook Ads? * Google Ads? * Native Ads? None of those. He went door to door. He found people with email lists and pitched them to switch to ConvertKit. One by one. **4. Narrow Your Niche** Here's a history of ConvertKit's positioning: * Email marketing for‚Ä¶ everyone ‚Äì MASSIVE niche * Email marketing for authors ‚Äì Small, target niche * Email marketing for professional bloggers ‚Äì Small, better suited niche * Email marketing for creators ‚Äì Larger niche If they had stayed at \"email marketing for... everyone\" I would not be here writing this post. **5. Scaling Partner Webinars** At one point,  ConvertKit had 13,000 customers and 4,000 affiliates. As part of the onboarding process, all new customers were given the opportunity to become affiliates. And each affiliate was given the chance to run a co-hosted webinar. **6. Smooth Onboarding** ConvertKit warm you up by collecting simple info through a clickable questionnaire during onboarding which is facilitated by significant social proof. **7. Conference For Connection** Why do ConvertKit host the Craft & Commerce Conference each year at significant expense? BRAND **8. Actually Living Brand Values** When I scroll to the ‚Äúvalues‚Äù section on the About Us pages on 99% of SaaS businesses: I cringe. They are most likely: * Incongruent * Uninspiring * Watered down * Ignored internally ConvertKit's on the other hand... are actually LIVED. **9. The Growth Potential Of Freemium** In an unprecedented move on their seventh birthday, ConvertKit introduce a Freemium plan. Why? To cut Mailchimp out of the market for one... but also to get more creators using their branded forms and web pages, further spreading the brand. They also have incorporated a \"Dropbox-esque\" usage based referral system to unlock new features based on inviting new users. **10. The Immaculate Conception** Nathan did three things prior to starting ConvertKit that set him up for success: * First, he got good a launching things * He then developed some of the skills needed to build a web application * Then he built an audience and a network So if you are considering starting a SaaS maybe work on those first ^^ ;) I hope these points help anyone here bootstrapping their SaaS!  I have also asked ConvertKit's Nathan Barry and Derrick Hicks (Director Of Marketing) to jump into the comments and answer any questions that you may have... so ask away!207 207100 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/2818924718162696/","year":"2020"},{"post":" Can you recommend a cold email ninja?...

Digging into the terms, I found that Ahrefs is going to use your site data: Ahrefs may anonymize and aggregate any data you share with the Service, including data associated with your Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts, and use it without identifying you for purposes of improving the Service - source: Ahrefs terms Why is this bad? Your keyword ranking and backlink data cannot be anonymized. They are not unique to you. When Ahrefs learns that your page is getting 1000 visits/month from a keyword it shows as volume 50, it's going to update those estimates. Suddenly, you lose your competitive edge and paying Ahrefs customers can get better insights than ever before. On the plus side, it's going to make Ahrefs data 10x better for paying customers, as the competitor data will only improve. To sum up, I don't recommend anyone uses AWT on their own sites, unless you're happy for competitors to see their site data too.16 1619 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3246852942036536/","year":"2020"},{"post":" Acquired 150,000+ new users for our chrome extension by spending ~$2000 on Tiktok influencers, 4 lessons for you: UPDATE: We just launched 2.0 of this chrome extension on ProductHunt, if you have any other questions AMA there :) https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tactiq-3 ## Details: * 3 months, outreach to 320 creators, 16 agreed, 21 video's created * Total spend - $1980 USD * Average $ per post - $82 (many creators asked for more than $50) * 7,363,561 impressions, 920,426 likes on Tiktok * 150,000+ new users (our tracking wasn't 100% accurate) # 4 Lessons for your SaaS growth hacking: 1. Student-focused videos outperformed work-focused by 10x+. If you market your product to students, Tiktok can work well for you. 1. Our best performing videos (views/likes/installs) were straight forward use-cases for students/personas. \"If you're a student, you need this app...\", \"if you're a designer, then this app is for you...\". Creative/humour videos had much lower view-to-install. If you try Tiktok, keep this in mind. 1. Personalise your creator outreach. We DM'd 280 creators with a generic template, leading to 10 creator collabs. Then we tried another 40 with a slightly (1-2 sentence) personalized template which lead to 6 creators working with us. The difference in time was 2 mins. = **Pro tip:** creator response rate was 3x higher via listed email vs social DM's (instagram etc). Mentioning the creators specific audience/benefit to them also improved responses. 1. Tech and Student niche creators outperformed on view-to-install rates by 3-4x. Freelancer, digital marketing, business and other niches had a much lower uptake. Obviously there's much more to this process than outlined here.

Especially when there's a lot of hype around a particular topic, and content distribution is a perfect example. So instead of hearing invest 10x more time into content distribution than production, here's what you'll get here: üîπ How I turn ‚õîÔ∏è 9 likes into ‚úîÔ∏è 200 likes and 100 comments üîπ A sophisticated content distribution system that I use Content Distribution Your Grandma Could Handle This title ain't clickbait. This is actually so easy to do, and yet only a few marketers seem to be doing it. I'll just give you an example. A few months ago, I commented on a post. My comment was a simple list of everything I was working on to grow our SaaS and it got 9 likes. Now, when you get 9 likes on a comment (which has very limited visibility), that usually means that it resonates with your audience and that it has some potential. If I stopped there, 9 likes would be all I got from it. But, I didn't stop there. I copied that entire comment and published it as a post on my LinkedIn profile. https://imgur.com/zDq8oVO Meh. 11 likes and 7 comments still ain't much. So I didn't stop there either. I went into Airtable with all the Facebook groups where I want to spread my influence to (evil laugh). https://imgur.com/uMTrSgi I opened most of them in separate tabs and reposted the same thing there. This took less than 5 minutes. And here's the engagement in a few of them. https://imgur.com/eOtTqb2 https://imgur.com/OLcf5Sr https://imgur.com/PnsIK7H https://imgur.com/6Q3h6I2 A single comment, distributed properly, generated around 200 likes and 100 comments. And as I keep saying, these aren't just vanity metrics. Whenever I do this, I get... ‚úîÔ∏è Job offers ‚úîÔ∏è People asking for marketing advice ‚úîÔ∏è Free trial signups ‚úîÔ∏è Paying customers ‚úîÔ∏è Invitations to AMAs in front of 17,000 members SaaS communities My framework for creating content that achieves all these goals is, again, so damn simple: 1. Do a good job 2. Document the process 3. Distribute it Most fail with **#1**, so that's why you don't see more of that content. Moving on to more sophisticated content distribution systems. **Content Distribution Your Grandma Could NOT Handle **My goal for our company in 2021 is to create the best content ever. The thing is, without proper content distribution systems in place, no one will see that content, regardless of how great it is. I'll show you how I'm doing it through an example again. Article title: **How Zapier Grew Their Remote Team to 300+ Employees With a 95% Retention Rate **This article is a breakdown of Zapier's systems that allowed them to build a huge, 100% remote company. We modeled some of their systems and they worked great for us too, taking us from 1 to 25 FTEs in a single year. So, we wanted to document this properly and let everyone benefit from what Zapier learned over the years. Creating content with distribution in mind is crucial here. First of all, I picked this topic because I'm counting on its viral potential. Ideally, once published, CEO of Zapier and every other employee is going to share this. But, I'm not sitting around and waiting for that to happen on its own. This is a 7,000-word mammoth article, so it's not really something you can just paste and publish as a post on Facebook. That's why I created writing guidelines. This is what the intro of every article in this content series should look like: ‚úîÔ∏è The hook (2-3 lines, focused on the outcomes) ‚úîÔ∏è The offer ('here's what you'll get reading this') ‚úîÔ∏è The graph (only if we find something relevant) Here's an example: *'Zapier grew from 0 to $50m ARR in just 6 years. Their whole team was 100% remote from the beginning, now counting 300 employees. 95% of their team members are still with them.* *In this article, I'll share all of the systems and processes that went into their epic story. If you want to learn from a 100% remote company and steal their tricks, stick to the end. '* https://imgur.com/o7XeFDw And now, this intro is a perfect teaser for promoting this piece all over the place. I've pasted that intro in the table below. https://imgur.com/uYefpZS These are all the social media channels where we'll be promoting every article we produce. Not just social media, we'll also do that on every major platform where our audience spends their time. https://imgur.com/qITEBpA For me, that's: üîπ Growth Hackers üîπ Indie Hackers üîπ Hacker News üîπ Reddit üîπ Medium You figure out where your audience spends their time. Finally, here's my entire distribution workflow: ‚úîÔ∏è Create content with distribution in mind ‚úîÔ∏è Add it to Airtable ‚úîÔ∏è Write a teaser based on the article intro (usually just copy/paste) ‚úîÔ∏è Adjust the teaser for each platform and add it to the table ‚úîÔ∏è Provide the VA with login credentials of all content platforms ‚úîÔ∏è Create detailed VA instructions for each platform (e.g. link in the comments) ‚úîÔ∏è Create a posting schedule ‚úîÔ∏è Assign the VA to post content all over the place ‚úîÔ∏è Assign the VA to gather the engagement data and add it to the same table ‚úîÔ∏è Repeat the same process 3 months later (create title/teaser variations) ‚úîÔ∏è Assign the VA to gather the engagement data and add it to the same table ‚úîÔ∏è Repeat again 6 months later (create title/teaser variations) ‚úîÔ∏è Assign the VA to gather the engagement data and add it to the same table ...and you can rinse and repeat this forever.50 5052 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3971460449575778/","year":"2021"},{"post":" Hey guys, I'm about to try new coldreach approach.
