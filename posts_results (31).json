Multiple small businesses and solo entrepreneurs have lately entered markets of all domains with products that are no less (if not better) than the big brand names. But as you’d know, the marketing and design of a product hold more value in the market than the product itself. So, how could these small business owners, mostly on tight budgets and with no prior design skills or technical tastebuds create excelling marketing content themselves? Enter Glorify!  As an easy-to-use graphic design software, Glorify offers fully customizable, e-commerce-oriented templates that make designing like a pro, without pro-know-how, 10x easier!  The Challenge: To significantly grow the traffic with lower backlinks & Drive Organic Conversions. Glorify approached REIN digital looking to ramp up their organic presence. Until the collaboration, Glorify had relied heavily on paid ads in order to drive conversions and traffic to their website. Their strategy was now to bank on a focused strategy and gain some dedicated SEO assistance to mark their foothold in this fiercely competitive space Historically Glorify was heavily dependent on paid ads to drive conversions and traffic which helped them attract about 2000 monthly organic traffic (majorly brand keywords).  We needed to: * Streamline user journeys and enhance UX to help visitors access relevant information more quickly * Off-set some technical issues on the website * Build their blog from scratch. * Lack of interlinking across important pages * Lack of on-page page optimization and content **The Solution: Insight, Optimization & Content** Our first step was to scrutinize the existing Glorify strategy. As unarguably one of the best and one of the only few websites in this domain, Glorify deserved a better online presence; and for that, they needed a better website design, a better marketing strategy, and a better overall game plan. After establishing a solid understanding of the problem within our team, we devised a new and effective SEO strategy to get the ball rolling. **SEO Audit** Through our deep-dive, we realized that there were multiple technical and security issues on the website, and fixing those took the top spot on our priority list. Crawler issues, Missing canonical tags, JavaScript vulnerabilities and security headers, etc. were some major issues to name.  **UX Design** The next step was the website overhaul. Our team brainstormed to find ways to make the website look more interactive and have an efficient website funnel; both from an SEO  as well as a customer standpoint. **On-Page Optimization** There was a serious gap between how Glorify's services were portrayed on the platform versus how the potential customers were searching for the same services. This mismatch resulted in the potential customers not converting to actual customers. In order to fix this issue, we curated an inventory of top keywords via an exhaustive competitor analysis and search volumes and created respective product pages for the same. Once we had the list in hand, we optimized their metas and resolved the gap from a technical SEO perspective. **On-Site Content** Until our collaboration, Glorify did not have any live blogs. Hence, the strategy here was to aggressively post fully optimized blogs on the website; with at least 1-2 articles going live per day for the initial 2 months; and 3-4 articles per week eventually. All the identified topics were strategically chosen based on multiple data points like the current trends, search volumes, competitor analysis, long-tail keywords, etc. The content was also refreshed on a regular basis to ensure the content freshness and to send across the right signals to AI bots. As a result, the impact was so high that we ranked our 1st keyword \"Funny zoom backgrounds\" in the top 3 positions globally, with 135k monthly search volume (Data source: SEMrush). Additionally, the overall search keywords (the top 100) went from 168 to 25,200 within 10 months. Link Building  Initially, for the first two months, we focused on web 2.0, forum, and profile links. Post which, our outreach team approached site owners within the same niche with high-quality, relevant links for link-building purposes, amongst multiple other technical factors. **Results: A Clear Win!** * **146.87%** growth in organic conversions * **1512%** increase in organic traffic in just 10 months * **112 **keywords started ranking on the top 3 positions depicting a 1600% growth * **976** keywords started ranking on the 4-10 positions * **415.70%** growth in backlinks * **12x growth** in revenues purely via organic channels P.S. It must be noted that the dip in April end /May was due to the migration of the core domain from \"glorifyapp.com\" to \"glorify.com\"23 2330 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3975861552469001/"},{"post":" …reciprocate on our Blog - blog.bookmark.com.

I'm at this point right now.  Here's the example: how to optimize content for seo The most important aspect of content for web optimization is the overall user experience. The user experience of your website and content is why people visit your website, not what you have to offer. This guide will guide you through the steps to improving the user experience and make it more convenient for your users and their devices. In 2020, users are looking for information on the devices, platforms, and services they use. Using search intent to analyze user experience. this guide will walk you through the various SEO strategies you can use to reach the end user. In our guide on how to optimize content for SEO, we recommend some simple steps you can take to increase user experience on your website, but the guide is also about understanding what the user experience means and knowing why the user is visiting your website. By understanding the user experience of your website, you can build a solid foundation for your website to improve your ranking on the SERPs. You'll also learn about how to take the SEO strategy you are using to rank well at scale and apply it to your website. And don't miss out on our guide on how to add videos, a crucial part of user experience. Understanding User Experience First, it is important to understand the basics of the user experience. The user experience and how you can affect it on your website. User experience is the product of how a user is going to interact with your app or service. How quickly, how conveniently, how satisfying, and how useful the experience is going to be is based on your choice of UI (user interface). The user experience is the sum of all the elements of your website. These can include The visual design that you create including colors, fonts, images, and videos Tone, readability, and accessibility The quality of the copy on the page The consistency of the information presented, including typography and layout The ease of navigation and the flow of the content The speed and loading time of the page So, the user experience is the combination of all these aspects. But, it doesn't mean that UX is all about visuals and UX means visual design. UX can be considered more than the visual design and is about the entire user experience.3 317 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3838945479493943/","year":"2020"},{"post":"","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/1674851255903387/","year":"2018"},{"post":" …content 4) Redistribute your content - one blog can go a long way: video, PPT, Linkedin post, Linkedin article, infographic, reach out to people in your market to link back to it Now, if you’re thinking ‘I’ve heard this before’ --- ask yourself, have you really tried it?

As I rocked a beard in the business world, I heard a lot of typical bearded stereotypes - Grizzly Adams, ZZ Top, and Duck Dynasty. While those are interesting people, they weren’t lifestyles that I personally identified with. \"We launched the Beardbrand e-commerce store a few days before I found out that my wife was pregnant with our first child. That gave me a tight deadline\" It was after attending an event with other bearded individuals similar to me that I realized there was an entirely new group of beardsmen. I coined the term “urban beardsman” to describe myself and people similar to me. An urban beardsman is a typical dude who doesn’t fit the traditional stereotypes that come with a beard. Beardbrand was created to unite urban beardsmen and give them the tools they needed to feel confident about being themselves. That meant creating a lot of content (blog posts, videos, and talking on podcasts). At first, we started with regular posts on Tumblr because that was the easiest platform to generate a bulk amount of content quickly. In addition to that, I wrote a few blog posts and created a few YouTube videos, but it was a very modest community. I think we had 300 YouTube subscribers after 12 months and only a hundred daily visitors to our blog. After about a year of creating content, we launched an e-commerce store to sell men’s grooming products and it’s been a grind ever since. Gradually, I reduced my commitment to my graphic design business and put those efforts into Beardbrand as it got traction. 📌 ////  Describe the process of creating Beardbrand. ////    We launched the Beardbrand e-commerce store a few days before I found out that my wife was pregnant with our first child. That gave me a tight deadline to grow Beardbrand to the point it could support our family or else I’d have to go back to the corporate world. In those very early days of Beardbrand, there was a bit of luck on our side. First, we were pretty much the only organization that took growing beards seriously (today everyone and their mom talks about beards & beard care). Because of that, it was easy for us to get noticed. In November of 2012, I was contacted by a reporter from the New York Times who was doing a piece on beards. I told my co-founders about it and suggested that we take advantage of the publicity and try to sell some products on an e-commerce store. It was at that moment that we decided to monetize the brand. We started our store by carrying a different brand’s products. I was familiar with a small beard oil & mustache wax manufacturer (think Etsy level business). So I reached out to that person and asked if we could resell their products at standard wholesale prices. He agreed, and we added two types of beard oil and one mustache wax available for purchase on our website. I believe the initial order was about $100 worth of products. For the platform, we decided to go with Shopify and built the website with one of their free templates. I used the photography from our manufacturer and wrote the copy myself. Because I was a graphic designer, I was able to build the website in about two days. We launched on January 28th, 2013, just two days before the New York Times article went live. I made a post on Facebook, and ironically the first customer of Beardbrand was also my first customer of my graphic design business. Then the New York Times article was published, which ended up driving about $515 worth of sales over the next seven days and gave me the motivation to grow and expand the business. In these early days, I was fulfilling the products myself and running them to the post office. Eventually, we partnered up with a fulfillment house so that we could focus on our marketing efforts. We are a truly bootstrapped company - no outside money, no bank loans, no debt. My co-founders purchased their shares of the company as we launched and we rolled any profits back into the business. We didn’t pull any cash out of the business for the first ten months, and then after that, it was a very modest salary. I’m fortunate to live a modest lifestyle, and my wife has a job that could support both of us. Without that, our story might be completely different. We were lucky to be the company to build a new industry - beard care. As the market leader, we were able to parlay that into copious amounts of PR which helped accelerate our growth. Our early wins were that NY Times article, but also we were included in some best beard oils articles that included our products. Those other articles ended up ranking well on Google and drove a good part of our business. Those articles were great, but our most significant PR event was appearing on Shark Tank on Halloween of 2014. The exposure from being on Prime Time TV is like none other. If you want to see what that did for our business, check out the write up I did over on Reddit. We’ve continued to have a lean mentality with our product launches and offering. We create small initial batch runs and modify our products based on the feedback from our customers. This minimizes risk and allows us to continue to grow as a bootstrapped company. It was about 7 or 8 months in that I felt the business had potential to support me and my family. We were doing about $25k/month at that time, but still not pulling anything out of the business. I’ve always thought Beardbrand has had potential to do 9 figures, so we are grinding away trying to figure out how to do that.

Because it allows you to qualify your audience. You don't need to be creating content that talks about how great your product is. All you need to do is create content that only your audience would find valuable, *and no one else*. This is **especially critical for B2B** since finding B2B leads are both difficult and expensive to get. Just by having your ideal audience raise their hand by reading content that speaks directly to them, you then have the opportunity to follow up with them for your offer.

As a first-time SaaS founder, I've learned so much from all the amazing people in this community and it was important for me to give back and share my learnings... So here's the recap of the last 3 years as a first-time SaaS founder: * Went from 0 to $4,000,000 ARR with lemlist * Sold lempod, our side project, after 18 months of hypergrowth * Scale our team to 23 amazing people * Raised $0 in fundings (fully bootstrapped) Here are the 7 key elements that have helped us get where we’re at today: 1- Build a family around your product instead of a community. Communities die, families prosper. 2- Invest heavily in your product - if you don't have a kickass product you will not make money. Product led growth is 🔥 3- Having a long term vision is far less important than being adaptable. Talk to your users every single day and adapt. Your goal is to find a solution to a problem. People who usually \"know better\" usually fail. 4- Without a kick-ass team you won't scale as fast. Invest in hiring and in making your recruitment process smooth. 5- Build processes from day 1. Everyone should be replaceable, processes will help you do just that! 6- Be transparent. Really. The more transparent the better your relationships will be. Whether it's with your customers, your team or the outside world. 7- Surround yourself with love ❤️  Building a business is not easy. It's a roller coaster and your motivation level need to be as high as possible if you want to succeed! If you want more details I will put the link to the whole article in the first comment. I hope that it will help you rock 2021 and that it might inspire some of you like I was inspired when I first started ❤️153 15357 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3529465173775310/","year":"2021"},{"post":" [LAUNCH IT MONDAY] You've been working hard on your stuff and it's time to let everyone know about it.

The product was built with software developers in mind, but today many types of companies use it successfully. Including marketing agencies, product teams, B2B SaaS, and even high growth startups. This is one problem, I don't know who to target! The second one is I'm just starting to think about diff channels and because of the limited resources and high threshold for testing a channel properly, I don't know where to start. As I'm a software developer, I don't have a gut feeling on which might be a good channel. The third one is the CLTV. We have customers paying from $20  per month to our biggest $820 per month because we get paid per seat. And it could be a lot higher for larger companies, so... this also blurs my thinking on what might be a good channel.

I had to: (1)flesh out my idea,  (2)create a prototype for free,  (3)make my first sales with the prototype,  (4)create partnerships with affiliate partners (that agreed they would promote the product after seeing the prototype and seeing I already had sales),  (5)create a partnership with a full-stack developer (after he saw I had a prototype, sales, and affiliate partners ready),  (6)create a killer launch offer and launch  After that, revenue started coming in and growing, so I then had to scale up the team, so I had to: (7)build out the team (dev team, support, finance/admin, and marketing) and manage the team to keep everyone aligned and moving forward These were my 7 steps to 7 figures.

The conversation is going great, I'm super engaged, and listening to their problems. Then we go to schedule the demo (and our time zones are usually way off) so I kindly ask if I can drop in my schedule link, they say Yes...and then I drop it in. There's honestly like a 50% drop off from giving them the schedule link to them actually scheduling something. Any advice on this?

Before building SaaS companies, I got my start as an entrepreneur as an internet marketer. Internet marketers have 1 huge superpower, and 1 huge weakness: Their superpower is that they spend 99% of their efforts on distribution and become amazing and eeking out profitable funnels on crappy products (their weakness). They talk about products, not in terms of solving the pain of a particular market, but in terms of price points. \"Hey I'm looking to promote a $997, anyone got a good converting product?\" What in the world. Product barely exists. And that leads to RAPID growth, but then flatlining because of churn and competition. Then I started my first SaaS company (Payfunnels) and was in for a shock. Most of the SaaS founders I talked to cared about 1 thing... PRODUCT. \"If you build it, they will come!\" \"The best product wins!\" These were the mantras chanted by fellow SaaS founders as they languished away at $15k MRR and barely-there growth. When we launched Proof, we were determined to do things different. Our plan was to take the best from each world. We would build a good product that solved a real pain, and we would scale it quickly through paid advertising into a high converting funnel. The result? 7 months in, we crossed $100k MRR 14 months in, we crossed $200k MRR Because of our fast growth we.... - got into Y Combinator - were able to get mentored by some of the most brilliant minds in Silicon Valley - Raised $2M (that we didn't even need) in less than a week - Upgraded our team big time - Were able to serve our customers even better The entire trajectory of our careers was influenced by 1 decision... \"Let's grow Proof FAST early on\" So yes, product matters a lot. Particularly if you want to build a huge company. But if you're a SaaS founder under $100k MRR And you have a decently good product... Then you need to turn on the jets and get growing. Most of you could add $100k MRR in the next 12 months using paid ads into 1 funnel. You've done the hard work of building it. Take the risk and get it out there. 1 ad platform. 1 funnel. Go. Get.

Ever wanted to pull a few million LI profiles and emails in an afternoon? Ever been tired of getting booted off LinkedIn for scraping too many profiles?  What most people don't realize is that Microsoft owns both Linkedin and Bing. This means that all LinkedIn profiles are perfectly indexed in Bing's search.  All you have to do to get them is use Bing's search operators to create your queries, then scrape the results and send them to your favorite email finding tool.  If you aren't a developer you can use Scrapebox.com to get the results.  If you are a developer, use scaleserp.com This process really gets interesting when you hit scale. You can only pull 1000 profiles per search but if you are creative in Google Sheets you can create hundreds of searches at a time. If I only need to search for one job title, I might grab a list of all cities in the US from Wikipedia and then add them to the end of each search. Now you have thousands of searches and millions of profiles.

Digging into the terms, I found that Ahrefs is going to use your site data: Ahrefs may anonymize and aggregate any data you share with the Service, including data associated with your Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts, and use it without identifying you for purposes of improving the Service - source: Ahrefs terms Why is this bad? Your keyword ranking and backlink data cannot be anonymized. They are not unique to you. When Ahrefs learns that your page is getting 1000 visits/month from a keyword it shows as volume 50, it's going to update those estimates. Suddenly, you lose your competitive edge and paying Ahrefs customers can get better insights than ever before. On the plus side, it's going to make Ahrefs data 10x better for paying customers, as the competitor data will only improve.

I think people underestimate the efforts required to build a good product website. If you wanted to get a direct analogy, your website is like your retail shop. If it's not well presented, structured correctly, cluttered all over the place. the customers won't enter the shop in the first place, even if they enter they will quickly walk away. Everyone knows it, but it's hard to fix it. The biggest challenge is you need to keep it simple. You need to resist the temptation of explaining every feature in the product, cutting that balance is harder. We worked with 3 different copywriters. Finally, it's a combination of our gut feeling based on customer interactions and bits and pieces from various copywriters. There is no right or wrong approach. Most of the time, people don’t like their website and always feel they are missing something. What we realized is, some of the items looked trivial, but in reality, consumed a lot of time. Example: getting testimonials, case studies, even getting quality profile pictures. There is a considerable amount of assets needed to create a good website.

I've seen some great validation (currently over $270 MRR, 6000+ registered users, 600+ Slack members, and some good engagement), but it's been slowing down.  I've done the usual Reddit, PH, Twitter, launches but these were never going to be my main source of traffic. Currently dabbling with content, SEO, Google Ads, testing the waters with anything I can find really.  I guess this is more of a discussion than it is a question — it feels overwhelming, the amount of things that I need to learn to find a sustainable way to drive traffic to my website, but it's fun. Do you have a framework to identify what you need to learn to grow your SaaS? (Specifically Marketing because I suck so much at this).14 1420 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/4189776864410801/"},{"post":" Thoughts on this strategy for SaaS startup.  Launch the startup completely Free. Once I hit my goal of 1000 users on the app and there is enough people utilizing it daily, then notify all users and charge $30 per month for it. I will probably see a drop off in users but I feel like as a new SaaS platform, charging money upfront will turn away people fast. I have been noticing that on my beta launch people get scared the moment they see $30 per month, I even have a 30 day free trial on it.12 1248 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/4208214215900399/"},{"post":" Looking for **B2B Cold Email Specialist**.

Building drip sequences, funnels, constant content creation, convincing people to buy isn't something I enjoy or are passionate about. I guess I'm realizing more than ever that I'm best as a \"product\" person and my own brand ambassador. I've forced myself to do it for far too long but it's time for a real change. I'm looking for suggestions in lieu of LTDs, hiring a marketing team, Facebook Ad experts, managing affiliates etc. It just distracts me and creates too much noise. My most successful efforts so far (assuming great product, price point, support, reviews) was finding business partners with huge audiences that are passionate about what I offer. They say \"We use this and your business NEEDS this!\" and everyone clamors to purchase. Maybe I need a commission structure more formal than a bunch of random affiliates? In short, I'm tired of trying to be fancy with all this stuff and just want others to take over marketing my creations. I already have a few amazing products that are just waiting for someone to scale... but doesn't everyone now? Haha! Any ideas or maybe suggest someone interested in this?22 2258 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3434192729969222/","year":"2020"},{"post":" >> How to create link-worthy quality content and generate tons of high quality backlinks to your site This one simple strategy got me links from high authority sites like GetResponse, Shopify,  etc. And I can wanted to share this with you because I know that a lot of you here focus content marketing and SEO. And that you struggle to grow your organic traffic. So this one strategy really helped me out when it comes to creating quality content that naturally attract links. I mean, you still need to do outreach to build links... But the good thing is that this type of content tends to attract a lot more of them. And it’s a lot easier to “convince” others to link to your content. Not only that but this type of content also tends to attract a lot of brand mentions as well and puts your name out there. (check out screenshot below) There are many ways to create link-worthy content. But here’s one of the ways: >> Original Research Content. Or simply explained - you conduct some kind of original research or a case study for content in order to prove a point. Then any time other bloggers want to prove the same point in their content - they will link to you. Which is one of the reasons why you get so many links. Because any time someone makes a statement in their post they need to prove it/ validate it. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be quality content and people won’t believe them. Which hurts their credibility. This is where your content piece saves them. They only need to link to it to prove their points. >> How to create content  based on some original research  Don’t worry, it’s not as hard as it seems. I will give you example with what I did here. I wrote a post on the topic of Email marketing vs Social Media. And I compared the two channels in the post and in which case which one is better. For this post surveyed a bunch of marketers and I asked them to share some examples. And this was as easy as sending them an email and asking them a simple question. Not only that. But these people also helped me with promoting the post later on when it was ready. The result: the post attracted tons of high-quality backlinks from high-authority sites. And it got us a lot of brand mentions as well. So let me know what you think about this strategy.  What do you currently do in order to generate high-quality backlinks to your site?7 75 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/2940099519378548/","year":"2020"},{"post":" For many reasons, the primary source of users for my tool will be strategic partnerships.

It's always been a side project, something I was building up alongside my agency, Zeda Labs. And I've been really frustrated about that for a long time.  While I enjoyed client work, it always took precedence over working on my thing. And it was always pushed to the side.  I struggled with that balance for a really long time until quarantine happened. In quarantine, there was a global shift in consciousness of people reassessing their priorities. While my life didn't change much, I felt that.  I thought about what I really wanted and where my heart really was. I knew I wanted to work on Conversion Crimes full-time, but something had to change to do that.  One day my friend Tommy Joiner asked me, \"what would it take to go all-in for 30-days and just see what happened?\"  So I did that, but once I did I got a taste annnnnnnddddddd... I was hooked.  I couldn't go back, no matter what the cost actually was.  Life is weird, the moment I made the decision to figure out how to go all-in on it was the moment everything changed.  Stuff came into alignment and opportunities became available beyond my wildest dreams.  So, here I am now after 3 years of grind and I finally have Minimal Marketable Product!!!!  What a huge milestone that is! 💪🏻   I haven't even told you what Conversion Crimes is... lol. It's usability testing service at it's core but we've reimagined it to be more fun, user friendly, and eliminate busywork.  To celebrate, I'd love to offer free video of someone going through your website to help you guys out and show you the power of usability testing.  **Just link your URL below and I'll send you a video of someone using your site. :) ** And if you're a hunter, I'd love an upvote just go to conversion crimes .com and click the PH banner - I'm fighting for #1 ! 🙏👊🏻49 4936 ","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaaSgrowthhacking/posts/3190037234384774/","year":"2020"},{"post":" Help a brother out...
